We have two lab days per month here at Mynewsdesk and one thing that never seems to stop receiving love is our chatbot [Flower][1] (for the [Flowdock][2] service). To keep the tradition alive I have now added a new command to the bot: [The Steve Jobs boom command][3]!

Type `!boom` in the chat and the bot will play a random clip of when Steve Jobs says boom through the office speakers.
