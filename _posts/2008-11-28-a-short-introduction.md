**Welcome to the blog!** I thought it would be appropriate to shortly present Newsdesk in a post before anything else.

If you don’t know about us (and chances are small you do, unless you’re living in Sweden), we are a Swedish equivalent to PRWeb, or PR Newswire in some ways.

We are an online visibility company. Corporations use Newsdesk to publish their news and press releases in dedicated press rooms. All with neat HTML formatting, embedded rich media and social applications such as dynamic tags and comments.

In the other end, journalists can register at the site for free to customize email alerts and subscribe to RSS feeds to monitor their field of work.

This is a very appealing way for corporations to reach “traditional media”, without the “traditional spam”. And also – with the online visibility – to reach their market and anyone that could be interested in what they have to say. Since we did our SEO homework, news releases published on Newsdesk tend to rank high in search engines.

We didn’t forget the blogosphere either. Using the Swedish service [Twingly][1] we display a “blogstream” of blogs linking to a specific news release.

Newsdesk first launched back in 2003, but is 100% Ruby on Rails since September 2006. Currently powered by Litespeed and PostgreSQL, but a migration to Phusion Passenger is planned within 2009. More inside information on this in future posts I’m sure!

With this blog we hope to share some of what we find during our daily work, including Ruby, Rails, SEO, Analytics/e-commerce and general thoughts about the life at a Swedish web company.
