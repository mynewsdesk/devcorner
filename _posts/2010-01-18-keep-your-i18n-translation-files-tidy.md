I added the Rake task [translate:remove\_obsolete\_keys][1] that lets you remove all obsolete translations from your YAML files. How is a translation rendered obsolete? Suppose you are translating from english to a number of other languages. Over time you may end up removing a number of I18n keys from the english translation file as your application evolves. The Rake task lets you remove those keys for all locales so you donâ€™t have to do that manually.
