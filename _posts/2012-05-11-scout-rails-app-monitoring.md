I saw this tweet from [Scout][1] just before leaving the office yesterday:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="sv">

It looked really promising, and we really like scout but are still using [New Relic][2] for the monitoring of our Rails app. So I sent them an email and the first thing we did this morning was to deploy the new Scout Rails monitoring of our Rails app.

We’re happy with it so far, it can surely replace New Relic:
